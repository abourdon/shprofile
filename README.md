## Why?

Because:

- We all need to manage our shell session by:
  - Setting the `PATH` or `PS1` variable
  - Setting a proxy
  - Adding aliases
  - Writing a configuration file for a particular command (e.g. [vim](https://www.vim.org/)'s `.vimrc`, [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)'s `.screenrc`)
  - Applying a mandatory initialization process for a particular command line (e.g. [jenv](http://www.jenv.be/), [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
  - ... _and so on_
- We may require to change those specific settings according to a given environment (e.g., by working in several contexts/clients), and thus need to manage several shell environments, or profiles, in parallel
- The more different environments we have, the more complicated it is to maintain our shell profile files (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`...)
- We want to backup our shell session settings by focusing only on our own settings

## How?

### Available features

- **Manage different shell session settings**, or profiles
- **Unclutter** shell session settings **by modularizing the configuration** and be able, for instance, to define 1 script file for 1 configuration/tool type and easily [import or export them](https://github.com/abourdon/shprofile/tree/master/examples/scripts)
- Apply a **lexicographical order** when discovering shell profiles' scripts
- Allow to define _loading_ and _unloading_ shell profile script types to **handle transition between profiles**
- **Remember the current profile in use** to be able to quickly reload it

### Concepts

`shprofile` manages a set of _shell profiles_ which can be enabled at any time. Scripts are executed within the current shell session, so scripts can modify the current shell environment.

#### Shell profile

Each shell profile is defined by a **set of scripts** contained into and associated folder from the `$HOME/.shprofile/profiles` profiles root folder.

For instance:

```
$HOME/
    .shprofile/
        profiles/
            myfirstprofile/
                script1.sh
                script2.sh
            mysecondprofile/
                script3.sh
                script4.sh    
```

defines two profiles, `myfirstprofile` and `mysecondprofile`, containing respectively the `script1.sh`, `script2.sh` and the `script3.sh`, `script4.sh` scripts.

Once profile is defined, it can be simply loaded via:

```bash
$ shprofile myfirstprofile
```

and be easily switched by another one via:

```bash
$ shprofile mysecondprofile
```

#### Shell profile memory

The current loaded profile is kept in memory (more precisely written into a file) to be quickly reloaded if necessary. The reload of the current profile can be done by calling `shprofile` without a profile name.

Thus,

```bash
$ shprofile
```

will reload the current loaded profile.

Note that this feature can be useful if a specific configuration needs to be executed at any shell session openings. See [further](#3-bootstrap-it) for more details.

#### Structure of a script

Each script is a shell script and can be anything you want: exporting variables, setting the `PATH`, applying a complex initialization process... **All scripts are executed within the current shell session**.

#### Name of a script

**The name of a script is important**. Depending on its name, a script is executed differently.

##### Execution order

Scripts are discovered by using the lexicographical order. Then, if you want to execute `script1.sh` before another one, a good practice is to use a numerical prefix in its name:

```
1-script1.sh
``` 

##### Execution type

There are two types of scripts:
- Loading scripts (by default)
- Unloading scripts

A script is by default a loading script. That is: executed when a profile is loading.

But sometimes it may be necessary to run scripts during the transition to another profile. In this case, there are unloading scripts. An unloading script is suffixed by the keyword `-unload`:

```
script2-unload.sh
```

##### Combine naming conventions

Of course, execution order and execution type can be combined.

Let's take an example:

```
$HOME/
    .shprofile/
        profiles/
            myfirstprofile/
                1-script1.sh
                1-script1-unload.sh
                script2.sh
                script2-unload.sh
            mysecondprofile/
                script3.sh
                script4.sh
```

In this scenario, the `1-script1-unload.sh` script will be executed when leaving the `myfirstprofile` profile, and before executing the `script2-unload.sh` script.   

##### Disable script execution

Any dot file is ignored. So to disable execution of a script, just prefix it by the `.` character.

### Getting started

#### 1. Install it

```bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.shprofile/profiles
$ curl -o $HOME/.shprofile/shprofile.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abourdon/shprofile/4.8/shprofile.sh
$ alias shprofile='source $HOME/.shprofile/shprofile.sh'
```

#### 2. Enable it

1. Now you can create your first profile by creating its associated folder within `$HOME/.shprofile/profiles`:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir $HOME/.shprofile/profiles/myfirstprofile
    ```

2. Add your desired scripts into it (some examples can be found [here](examples/scripts/))

3. And finally enable it

    ```bash
    $ shprofile myfirstprofile
    ```

#### 3. Bootstrap it

A common use is to load the current profile at each shell session opening. Depending on your shell, this enabling can be done differently.

##### Bash

```bash
$ echo "alias shprofile='source $HOME/.shprofile/shprofile.sh'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
$ echo 'shprofile' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

##### Zsh

```bash
$ echo "alias shprofile='source $HOME/.shprofile/shprofile.sh'" >> $HOME/.zshrc
$ echo 'shprofile' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```

### Need help?

```bash
$ shprofile --help
```

### Examples of shell profile's scripts

Some examples of shell profile's scripts can be found [here](examples/scripts/).

## Difference with `/etc/profile.d` and alternatives

`shprofile` can be seen as a combined version of `/etc/profile.d` (because of its modular architecture) and `.bash_profile` (because focusing on a single user), by adding the ability to:
- define several profiles
- not being constrained to use a shell type specific user profile file (e.g., `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile`)

Some alternatives to `shprofile` could be:
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- [use](https://github.com/justincampbell/use)
- [terminal-setup](https://github.com/pfwd/terminal-setup)
